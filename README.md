# Blackjack-Game

Blackjack is a casino banked game, meaning that players compete against the house rather than each other. The objective is to get a hand total of closer to 21 than the dealer without going over 21 (busting).

**The Objective of Blackjack**

Beat The Dealer. There are some misconceptions about the objective of the game of blackjack but at the simplest level all you are trying to do is beat the dealer.

**How the game starts?**

First, dealer will deal two cards to you and two cards to himself/herself. Your cards will be shown but dealer's one card will be hidden and another will be shown.

**How do you beat the dealer?**
1) By drawing a hand value that is higher than the dealer’s hand value
2) By the dealer drawing a hand value that goes over 21.
3) By drawing a hand value of 21 on your first two cards, when the dealer does not.

**How do you lose to the dealer?** 
1) Your hand value exceeds 21.
2) The dealers hand has a greater value than yours at the end of the round

**How do you find a hand’s total value?**

Blackjack is played with a conventional deck of 52 playing cards and suits don’t matter.

1) 2 through 10 count at face value, i.e. a 2 counts as two, a 9 counts as nine.
2) Face cards (J,Q,K) count as 10.
3) Ace can count as a 1 or an 11 depending on which value helps the hand the most.

**How to hit or stand in game?**

**Hit**: If you would like more cards to improve your hand total, the dealer will deal you more cards, one at a time, until you either “bust” (go over 21) or you choose to stand. There is no limit on the number of cards you can take (other than going over a total of 21).

**Stand**: If your first two cards are acceptable, you can stand and the dealer will move on to the next player.
